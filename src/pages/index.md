    Welcome to Low Level Views operating in the County of Herefordshire in the
    United Kingdom. 


    Registered with the Civil Aviation Authority, I have a current Permission
    for Commercial Operations from them (registration number UAS 10365). 


    Why not have a look at my portfolio so you can see the type of work I have
    completed to date. 


    Working with you and your team collaboratively we will define clearly and
    concisely what you want to achieve, and by when. 


    All jobs are risk assessed in advance and on the day of the flights in line
    with the PfCO rules set by the CAA and are both weather and flight area
    dependent.  If on the flight day I as the Remote Pilot determine that is it
    not safe to fly, then we will have to reschedule.  Frustrating I know;
    however, I always fly safely and within the CAA regulations.


    So please feel free to look around the website and then let’s talk to see
    what we can do together…

        From Crop inspections through to  looking for drought patches,
        fertiliser application or weed growth, the 4K photos will usually tell
        the Farmer and his Agronomist how the crops are progressing through the
        seasons. 


        Agricultural Surveys: 

        Searching for 50 year land Drains. Look closely at the above photo and
        you can see the herring bone pattern on the ground showing the farmer
        where his land drains are that he installed 50 years ago.

        Facilities Management of animal husbandry buildings and identifying
        potential planning application issues can be identified through Drone
        photography for the Client's business partners to discuss with their
        services suppliers.

        Flooding Impact photos can often be of help when working with Parish
        Councils and various Agencies.

        Often a simple aerial photo provides the necessary information to enable
        risk based decisions to be made for example in planning applications and
        environmental issues/impact.
