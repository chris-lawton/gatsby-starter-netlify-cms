  title: About us
  description: >
    Welcome to Low Level Views operating in the County of Herefordshire in the
    United Kingdom. 


    Registered with the Civil Aviation Authority, I have a current Permission
    for Commercial Operations from them (registration number UAS 10365). 


    Why not have a look at my portfolio so you can see the type of work I have
    completed to date. 


    Working with you and your team collaboratively we will define clearly and
    concisely what you want to achieve, and by when. 


    All jobs are risk assessed in advance and on the day of the flights in line
    with the PfCO rules set by the CAA and are both weather and flight area
    dependent.  If on the flight day I as the Remote Pilot determine that is it
    not safe to fly, then we will have to reschedule.  Frustrating I know;
    however, I always fly safely and within the CAA regulations.


    So please feel free to look around the website and then let’s talk to see
    what we can do together…

        the Farmer and his Agronomist how the crops are progressing through the
        seasons.
