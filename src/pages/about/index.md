After 6 years of flying drones recreationally with full leisure insurance, I decided to take the plunge and study for my Permission for Commercial Operations (PfCO).  I passed my theory test and then the practical  flight assessment.  This enabled me to successfully obtain my PfCO from the Civil Aviation Authority in October 2019. 

I have full commercial drone insurance with [Flock](https://flockcover.com/).
