### What's your background?

After 6 years of flying drones recreationally with full leisure insurance, I decided to take the plunge and study for my Permission for Commercial Operations (PfCO).  I passed my theory test and then the practical  flight assessment.  This enabled me to successfully obtain my PfCO from the Civil Aviation Authority in October 2019. 

I have full commercial drone insurance with [Flock](https://flockcover.com/).

### What's the first step?

When we first meet to discuss your requirements, I will show you CAA PfCO certificate, so you know I am fully licensed.  After detailing your requirements I will carry out a pre-flight assessment which includes weather forecast for the day of the flights along with checking the CAA’s Notice to Airmen (NOTAMs) for planned flight restrictions/information the CAA has for the area I will fly in for you. 

I will also obtain a provisional insurance quote for this work.  

At this stage I will give you a fixed price for my services. This covers the insurance, completed risk assessments, flying the drone(s), taking the photos/videos and then the final production of them to you in the format you wish to receive them in. 

### Which regions do you cover?

Currently I am only working  in the County of Herefordshire so there are no travelling costs that I will bill you for the pre-site assessment and on site work on the day and the if required the post flight meeting with the photos/videos. 

### What happens on the day?

On the agreed day on the flights first, I will complete an on-site risk assessment taking account of many things along with checking the weather conditions and CAA NOTAMs. If I decide it is safe to fly, I will then obtain an insurance quote from Flock and then if you still wish to go ahead, I then fly the drone. 

On most occasions you will be able to see what the drone’s on-board camera sees and decide on the photos and videos you need. 

### What happens once the flight is complete?

Once I have completed the flights, depending on your needs I will then prepare the photos and videos back at home.  Finally, I will either email them to you or if they are very large file sizes, I will bring them to you on a USB pen drive for you to load into your computer/tablet etc. Included will be a full debrief of the images/video captured.
